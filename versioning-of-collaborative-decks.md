# Versioning of collaborative decks
Decks should maintain a versioning system so that users know when there is an update. It should include atleast a `major.minor` versioning system e.g. X.Y where changes to X mean major changes that affect progress of existing cards and Y means minor change. A changelog file should be maintained to keep track of changes between versions.

## Major changes
Major changes entail a significant change to the questions or answers of existing card(s). This policy should be strict enough to include ANY rewording of an existing Q/A because after all, we are talking about changing content people have gone to the trouble of memorizing.

## Minor changes
Minor changes include adding of new cards and small changes to existing cards such as formatting or styling. If your deck's card types utilizefields that are not essential to the core question or answer of a card (e.g. a "Context" field on the front or an "Extra" field on the back), changes tp these foelds could be considered a minor change.
