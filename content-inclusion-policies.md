In the spirit of the third rule of formulating knowledge (build upon the basics), maintainers of collaborative decks should decide on what content is notable enough to be included in the deck. As an example, the [Ultimate Geography deck](https://github.com/axelboc/anki-ultimate-geography/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#content-inclusion-rules) uses different rules for different types of geographical entities. At the time of this writing, some of the key factors that they consider include:
* population
* area
* distance from mainland (when applicable)

Extended versions of collaborative decks can be created and released under the same project. These can include cards that ordinarily wouldn't meet the content inclusion requirements of the basic deck, but contain supplemental information.
